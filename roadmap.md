# Dyson Farm Co Feature Roadmap

A top-down 2D farming + automation game with a satirical twist. You're not saving the farm - you're expanding the last megacorp.

---

## Phase 1: MVP Prototype (Core Loop in CT.js)
- [x] Basic player movement (WASD + animation)
- [ ] Modular grid system with snapping or placement rules
- [ ] Tile-based world with interactable farm plots
- [ ] Crop system: plant → grow over time → harvest (uses time system)
- [ ] Basic time system (used to drive plant growth, not visual day/night)
- [ ] Inventory system (basic)
- [ ] Sell harvested crops for currency
- [ ] Build machine placement system (hotbar or UI-based)
- [ ] First automation unit: Crop Harvester
- [ ] Conveyor belt system to move goods
- [ ] Save/load basic game state

---

## Phase 2: Core Gameplay Expansion
- [ ] Simple power system (machines require energy to run)
- [ ] Additional machines: seed planters, watering units, composters, etc.
- [ ] Factory-style crafting: turn crops → materials → products
- [ ] Multi-tiered crops with different growth/sell values
- [ ] Machine upgrades (e.g. faster output, more efficient)
- [ ] Storage containers or silos (automated item handling)
- [ ] Research/unlock tree for machines and tech
- [ ] Visual day/night cycle (cosmetic only)

---

## Phase 3: Progression & World-Building
- [ ] Story intro: Inherit a dystopian megacorp farm in a world where *mom-and-pop stores dominate*
- [ ] Expandable land or multi-zone farming (e.g. fog of war / unlockable plots)
- [ ] Economy system: market prices fluctuate, respond to supply
- [ ] Contracts or delivery missions (fulfill specific orders)
- [ ] Worker bots or helper drones (basic AI and task routing)
- [ ] Pollution or trade-off systems (e.g. speed vs efficiency)
- [ ] Corporate ranking system or boardroom upgrades
- [ ] Tutorial or onboarding system
- [ ] Simple cutscenes or flavor text for humor/worldbuilding

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Final Touches
- [ ] Music + SFX (ambient farm vs factory)
- [ ] UI/UX polish: crafting menus, machine UIs, tooltips
- [ ] Settings menu (audio, controls, save management)
- [ ] Particle effects for machines, crop growth, power grid
- [ ] Achievement system or player milestones
- [ ] Export playable Web build for feedback/demo
